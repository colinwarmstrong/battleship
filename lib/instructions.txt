INSTRUCTIONS:
Battleship is a naval combat game played between two
players. After placing two ships, players will take
turns firing shots at the enemy board trying to sink
the enemy ships.

PLACING SHIPS:
Each player places two ships on the board at the
beginning of the game. The destroyer is a two
unit ship and the submarine is a three unit ship.
When prompted, place ships by entering each
coordinate separated by a space in the form A1.
Ships must be placed horizontally or vertically,
all ship units must be adjacent, and the units
cannot wrap around the board.

FIRING SHOTS:
After placing ships, each player will alternate
firing shots at the enemy by entering a coordinate.
You will know if a shot misses, hits a ship, or sinks
a ship. If a shot sinks a ship, you will be told
which ship you sunk. This continues until one player
sinks both enemy ships.

WINNING THE GAME:
The first player to sink all the enemy ships wins
the game.

GOOD LUCK!
